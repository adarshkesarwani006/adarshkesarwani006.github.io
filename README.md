# Adarsh Kesarwani

Namaste🙏 I'm Adarsh Kesarwani, an Electronics Graduate from Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.

I'm a Programmer, Web Developer, Android Developer, and Electronics enthusiast. I undertake various exciting side projects in these fields. Essentially, I consider myself a Jack of all trades, constantly honing my skills. I am continuously amazed and intrigued by the potential of current technology and its profound impact on people's lives.

## What Makes My Portfolio Unique
I've broken away from the traditional horizontal portfolio website that requires scrolling. My portfolio website is scroll-proof 😜. Feel free to explore my portfolio, and if you come across any relevant opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out via email.

Thank you for your time,
Over and Out!!!
